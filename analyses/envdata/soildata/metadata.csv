soildepth,soil depth,cm,component,weighted average,"Used major components only. Used component restriction, component diagnostic features, component horizon name, and component horizon texture to determine depth of soil to restrictive horizon. If no restriction was found, the maximum horizon bottom depth was used."
pondfreqcl_dc,ponding frequency,factor,component,dominant condition,Assigned most common ponding frequency from component month table to each component. Then used dominant condition to determine frequency for map unit 
flodfreqcl_dc,flooding frequency,factor,component,dominant condition,Assigned most common flooding frequency from component month table to each component. Then used dominant condition to determine frequency for map unit 
drclassdcd,drainage class,factor,component,dominant condition,"Queried directly from the muaggatt table. This column displays the dominant drainage class for the map unit, based on composition percentage of each map unit component"
aws0100wta,available water supply 0-100 cm,cm of water,component,weighted average,"Queried directly from the muaggatt table. The volume of water that the soil, to a depth of 100 centimeters, can store that is available to plants. It is reported as the weighted average of all components in the map unit, and is expressed as centimeters of water"
