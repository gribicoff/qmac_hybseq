# _Quercus macrocarpa_ hyb-seq analyses
This repository contains code and non-fastq data for a hyb-seq study of genomic coherence, hybridization, and introgression in five of the most common eastern North American white oaks (_Quercus_ sect. _Quercus_). Analyses were conducted by Gabe Ribicoff (this repository), and the project was led by Andrew Hipp (ahipp@mortonarb.org).
